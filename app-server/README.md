# m1m-jukebox Project

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: https://quarkus.io/ .

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
mvn compile quarkus:dev -Dquarkus.http.host=0.0.0.0
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Packaging and running the application

It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:
```shell script
mvn clean package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```
The application is now runnable using `java -jar ./target/m1m-jukebox-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar`.

```
